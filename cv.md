# Curriculum Vitae

## Abstract

---

### Career statement
Explorer of the data and analytics landscape with 8+ years professional experience in project formulation and execution,
spanning academic search for knowledge to value-driven development.
I am a generalist at heart, who thrives on challenges and enjoys combining broader strategic questions with technical 
deep dives.

With a Ph.D. in astrophysics and contributions to all phases of project deliveries, I have extensive experience in 
coordinating efforts in cross-functional teams; acting point-of-contact between team and stakeholder; and leading 
technical work with data of varied nature and quality.
I am classically schooled in model development, image analysis and applied statistics, presently focusing on curation, 
enrichment and analysis of structured data.

### Keywords
- Investigations and pre-studies
- Statistical modelling
- Technical leadership

### Experience highlights
- Contributing to a medallion architecture based data platform for standardization and automation of data collection; 
and cleaning, curation and enrichment of sensor data for analytics applications.
- Implemented decision models for economic- and carbon footprint improved energy imports, 
resulting in a tentative 15% reduction of costs when accounting for a building's response to a temporally varying 
load-function.
- Integrated classical algorithms into NN-based data streaming services to enable real-time object tracking 
and avoid image queue buildup.
- Conducted observational studies of galaxies using a gas cross-section selection (70-80% success rate), which enabled 
the faint, low-mass end of scaling relations established for deep luminosity-selected surveys to be extended by 1.5 dex, 
 i.e. by a factor of 30.
